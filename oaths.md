title: Sacred Oaths of the Academie
---

In the spring of 2009, a growing discussion came to a head and newer, less wordy versions of the various Academie oaths were created.  The first time one of the new oaths was heard was at the Academie of the Rapier event held on 9 May, 2009.  Custom may change over time but for now, either version of the oath can be used as desired.

* [Provost's Oath](provost)
* [Free Scholar's Oath](free-scholar)
* [Scholar's Oath](scholar)
* [Oath of Fealty](fealty)
* [Scroll Text for a Provost](scroll-text)
