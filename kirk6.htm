Human physiology is a complicated subject.  That's why doctors spend
years in school and then tell you to take 2 aspirin and call them in the
morning.  Actually this missive will hopefully provide the basic anatomy
lesson that all fighters should have.
<BR><BR>
Starting at the top, you know, that big round thing you stick inside
your mask, is your head.  A good blow to the head is generally considered
fatal or at least incapacitating.
There are so many blood vessels in your face that even a light cut to
the forehead would be disabling.  You couldn't see your opponent because
of the blood.  Nicks to the chin, cheek, or nose would be painful, but
not incapacitating.  Throughout this article, I am primarily discussing
real thrusts to the body.  Flesh wounds to the face, shoulders, torso,
legs, etc. are in general painful, but not immediately deadly.  Remember
flesh wounds when we discuss blood loss at the end of this missive.  A
last note on the head, a standard convention is that you treat your mask
as if it is your face.
<BR><BR>
Your neck is just as vulnerable as your face.  In fact, any thrust
to the neck should be considered deadly.  If it didn't cut your jugular
artery, then it punctured your windpipe or cut the muscles that keep
your head erect.  In either case, you're feeling lousy.
<BR><BR>
Your shoulders do more than provide a place for your arms to hang.  The
muscles in your shoulders allow you to lift you arms, and hold your head
up.  A thrust or draw cut to the top of the shoulder will not only disable
you arm, but your head will tend to flop over on the other side.  If you
were leaning forward, the rapier went through your collar bone, giving
you a punctured lung.  At best, a shoulder shot will only disable an
arm. 
<BR><BR>
Speaking of lungs, what about your torso.  Yes, obviously, a thrust
to the lungs or heart will be a kill.  But what about the stomach,
intestines, or other internal organs.  While a shot to these might not
be immediately fatal, these are the most painful of injuries.  You would
be unable to continue purely due to the agony.  And anyway, with a
typical gut wound, you will die in three weeks of peritonitis.
<BR><BR>
Draw cuts to the ribs or underarm are also not fatal.  However,
many muscles were severed with that cut.  A draw cut along your ribs
would be excruciating.  A light scratch might be painful, but not
debilitating, but a real draw cut would probably put you out of action.
<BR><BR>
Draw cuts to the underside of the arm are fatal.  Your brachial
artery is located there.  A draw cut there will cause almost instant
shock, and death very shortly thereafter.
<BR><BR>
Draw cuts to the inside of the leg are also fatal.  The femoral
artery is just inside your thighs.  A thrust to the inner thigh should
be treated as a kill as well, not just a leg wound.
<BR><BR>
Speaking of leg wounds, lets set the record straight now.  If you have
a leg wound, you will be on your knee (note singular form).  You would
want to keep as much pressure off you injured leg as possible.  So if
you are on the ground, either put your weight on your good leg, or sit
on your rump.  Incidently, people with leg wounds do not leap at their
opponents.
<BR><BR>
On a final note, blood loss is difficult to determine from minor
wounds.  There are many accounts of real duels being stopped because one
of the opponents fainted due to blood loss.  If you have received a
non-fatal wound, ask yourself, "How much blood have I lost, and how long
can I stand the pain?"  Please understand, we are coldly fighting a
duel, not raging with bloodlust in the middle of a battle capable of
ignoring severed limbs.  Fighters who yield a bout because of injuries
sustained are generally considered the most honorable, and respected in
the kingdom.
