The following poems were commissioned by Lord Philip Bell.  The
first part was read as a pledge from all entrants in the Atlantian Rapier Melee
Tournament held at Pennsic XXV.  The response was then read for HRM Katharina
von Straubing back to the fighters.  It was definately one of those "moments"
and those gentles that were there know how special it was.

<H3>Pledge of the Rapiers at the Queen's Tournament:</H3> <I>by Mar Yaakov HaMizrachi</I> <HR SIZE=5>
<P>
Sing praise for the Rose and her thorns of steel!<BR>
Her grace and beauty gentle and inspire!<BR>
We pledge to you our blades and humbly kneel.<BR>
<P>
We beg, oh fairest Queen, please do not deal<BR>
Harshly and reject those who, with hearts on fire,<BR>
Sing praise for the Rose and her thorns of steel!<BR>
<P>
Rather, seeing now how deeply we do feel,<BR>
Allow us to accomplish our desire.<BR>
We pledge to you our blades and humbly kneel.<BR>
<P>
Our blades so blessed, we'll wield them with such zeal<BR>
Their music will, as sweet as David's lyre,<BR>
Sing praise for the Rose and her thorns of steel!<BR>
<P>
To Katharina, dream of love made real,<BR>
(Can any man think any cause be higher?)<BR>
We pledge to you our blades and humbly kneel.<BR>
<P>
Upon our oaths and hearts now set your seal.<BR>
Then will we cry as loud as Heaven's choir -<BR>
"Sing praise for the Rose and her thorns of steel! <BR>
We pledge to her our blades and humbly kneel."<BR>

<P>
I shall accept your pledges and your swords <BR>
On one condition, which I forthwith name:<BR>
Show courtesy with deeds, not with mere words.<BR>
Seek honor with your blades, not fleeting fame,<BR>
Lest you should stain my crown with tears of shame.<BR>
If each of you for virtue does his part,<BR>
I shall accept your oath with all my heart.
