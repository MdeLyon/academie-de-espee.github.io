We salute you, assembled crowns.<BR>
Gathering from the corners of the Earth,<BR>
You do us all immeasurable honor<BR>
By gracing our contest with your presence.<BR>
We pledge to struggle to prove worthy;<BR>
And vow no stain shall darken our bright blades.<BR><BR>
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE>
Yea, so swear all these brave, bold blades.<BR>
(For each owes you a debt, oh mighty crowns,<BR>
For declaring each of them most worthy<BR>
To represent you on this field of earth<BR>
And blood. So each must thank you for his presence<BR>
Here by this oath upon his life and honor.)<BR><BR>
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE>
This we swear: that we shall honor<BR>
All the good blows and cuts of our foes' blades.<BR>
That we shall, at all times, treat our presence<BR>
On this field as an embassy of our crowns;<BR>
Whose trust we value more than all the Earth,<BR>
And of whose faith in us we will prove worthy.<BR><BR>
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE>
We swear to hold each foe worthy<BR>
Of our best respect and highest honor.<BR>
We call upon the Heavens and the Earth<BR>
To bear witness to our words.  May our blades<BR>
Break and points dull if we defile our crowns<BR>
By breaking this oath in their sacred presence.<BR><BR>
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE>
We ask He whose holy Presence<BR>
Makes even meanest men such as we worthy<BR>
Of Salvation, King of Kings, Crown of Crowns,<BR>
Bind us to this oath of sacred honor.<BR>
May He hear us and bring blessings on our blades;<BR>
Or, if we prove false, smite us from the Earth.<BR><BR>
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE>
Our oath done, we kneel upon this earth.<BR>
We reverance your majestic presence.<BR>
Saluting you by raising up the blades<BR>
That we have pledged you will find worthy<BR>
Not through mere victory, but through honor.<BR>
So shall chivalry adorn your golden crowns.<BR><BR>
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE>
For what gem of Earth could prove more worthy?<BR>
What presence grace your brow more than honor?<BR>
So pledge we our blades, and salute the crowns!<BR>
