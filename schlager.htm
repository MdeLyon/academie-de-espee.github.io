Unto the worthy populace of Atlantia, Spring Greetings from Alan Gravesend,
Deputy Earl Marshall for Rapier!
<P>
This is going to be a long one, so I will get straight to the point.   Herewith  the
Experimental Schlager Rules for Atlantian Rapier:
<P>
Schlager will require a separate
authorization conducted by designated schlager  marshalls (of which there are now two:
myself and Lord Giacomo Vicente di Firenze.   Others will be added as time/training/
interest allow.  Fighters must have been  authorized in rapier or armored combat for at
least one year before attempting to  authorize with schlager.  Schlagers may be used in
tourney rounds between two  schlager-authorized fighters provided they and the Rapier
Marshall in Charge agree,  but will not be used against epees or foils.
<P>
Schlager blades will be commerically manufactured blades designated by the  manufacturer
as practice schlager blades.  The condition of the blade will be the  same as for foils
and epees, with the exception that a single gradual curve is  <I>not</I> required in a
schlager.  Schlagers may have open guards (i.e. swept hilt style).   Blades will be
tipped with a rubber blunt, with a layer of rubber on the end of  the blade itself, on
top of which there shall be a metal disc (preferrably a  kingdom coin, but this is a
matter of taste).  Bird/Rabbit blunts sold for archery  are acceptable on an experimental
basis.  The tip shall remain on the blade when  tugged stoutly, and the blade must bounce
when dropped tip downward on a hard  surface, or the blade shall not pass inspection.
<P>
Armor for schlager will consist of standard Atlantian rapier armor plus a rigid  (see
Society armor standards) gorget that protects the jugular notch and the  sternoclavicular
joint (ask your chirurgeon if you don't know where these are).   As always, individuals
may choose to wear more protection if they wish, provided  that it does not interfere
with blow calling.
<P>
Blow calling with schlagers shall remain the same as with foils and epees -- a  valid
thrust requires only positive force in line with the blade; a valid draw  requires
positive force and a draw of 1/3 of the blade.  The Deputy Society Marshall  for Rapier,
Don Tivar Moondragon, tells me that the Corporate Rapier Rules will  not allow for wrist
generated cuts.  I will be discussing the issue with Don Tivar,  and I hope to persuade
him to allow these in the future.
<P>
Authorizations for schlager will be conducted according to very rigid standards, as will
tournament rounds including schlager combat.  This is a very different form  for us, one
that we are not accustomed to.  It is very likely that we will be seeing  a mix of
fighters coming in from both the armored combat arena and from rapier, and  it will
take time before common standards are reached, so we all must be patient.   Even with
that in mind, let it be known that the rapier marshallate has a zero  tolerance policy
with regard to unsafe conduct with these blades.  Any fighter on  the field who conducts
him/herself in an unsafe manner will be removed from the  field immediately; a second
instance will result in the suspension of the fighter's  schlager authorization for a
period of at least three months.
<P>
I strongly recommend that those of you who are interested in schlager find someone who
has experience with schlager to practice with, and that you practice and study  diligently.
Lord Giacomo and I will be conducting schlager classes (for fighers and  marshalls)
throughout the kingdom over the next few months, starting with the  University of Atlantia
in June.  While I do not want to make it seem as if schlagers  are dangerous (which they are
not) I do want to ensure that this new form makes a  smooth and safe entry into our game in
this kingdom.
<P>
These rules will remain in effect for six months, beginning on June 1, 1996 (subject, of
course, to the pleasure of the Crown and the approval of the Earl Marshall).  It  is very
likely that they will be modified during that time period, so watch this space  for updates.
<P>
Any and all questions regarding schlager and these rules should be directed to me,

In Service,
<P>
Alan
