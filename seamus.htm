For reference:
<BR><BR>
Malagentia is southern Maine, and the Northguard is a 
mercenary company that exists largely in Maine but has some members 
scattered over the rest of the East - and a few other places too...

'Twas the hot and dusty weekend<BR>
Of the 7th Great Northeastern War<BR>
When pirates stood to battle<BR>
On Malagentia's fair shores<BR>
Two ships there were and proudly flew<BR>
The banners from their prows<BR>
To gain the other's treasure<BR>
Was their most solemn vow<BR>
<BR>
The ships sailed on through the high seas<BR>
And slowly wheeled about<BR>
'Til broadside to each other<BR>
Then the grappling hooks were out<BR>
Curses vile were hurled forth <BR>
As the pirates drew their blades<BR>
Sunlight flashed from sharpened steel<BR>
As they readied the gangplanks<BR>
<BR>
The galleons closed for battle<BR>
And the gangplanks were thrown down<BR>
Bellowing their defiance<BR>
The scoundrels sallied out<BR>
Blade clashed on blade and blood ran free<BR>
And one man lead the fray<BR>
A landless rogue, a pirate born<BR>
And Seamus was his name<BR>
<BR>
Neither tall nor short was Seamus<BR>
Yet he had a commanding air<BR>
And certainly his men did follow<BR>
The beacon of his fiery red hair<BR>
That battle raged back and forth<BR>
For long hours through the day<BR>
But Brita and _her_ crew were winning<BR>
Much to Seamus' dismay<BR>
<BR>
But then, Seamus saw the tide had turned <BR>
And he rallied forth his side<BR>
He led his men in a valiant rush<BR>
While poor Brita stood and tried<BR>
To guard the bags of loot that were<BR>
Stacked between her feet<BR>
Because Heaven knows on Northguard pay<BR>
You can't afford to eat<BR>
<BR>
Fair Brita fell dead where she stood<BR>
Defending her pile of gold<BR>
Seamus' men ransacked her ship<BR>
And searched the cabins below<BR>
They brought forth all the loot they found <BR>
And dumped it in a pile<BR>
They cheerfully worked on through the night<BR>
Singing all the while;<BR>
<BR>
"We're thieves and killers and cut-throats<BR>
Our hearts are black and vile<BR>
We like to kill and loot and burn<BR>
Screams only make us smile...."<BR>
Seamus grinned cheerfully as he watched his crew<BR>
Dump the bodies from the ships<BR>
With fewer men, there'd be more gold<BR>
For the rest of them to split<BR>
<BR>
And so Seamus was victorious<BR>
His men had carried the day<BR>
He himself had come out unscathed<BR>
From the bloody, mindless fray<BR>
And we in Malagentia<BR>
Live in fear and dread<BR>
That he had so much fun, he'll come back next year<BR>
To loot and kill again.<BR>
