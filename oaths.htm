  In the spring of 2009, a growing discussion came to a head and newer, less wordy versions of the various Academie oaths were created.  The first time
  one of the new oaths was heard was at the Academie of the Rapier event held on 9 May, 2009.  Custom may change over time but for now, either version
  of the oath can be used as desired.

Henceforth, you will hold to these conditions of our Order, which
have been made known to you here, in the presence of your fellow Provosts.
<BR><BR>
You shall be a loyal subject to our Sovereigns, King ________ and Queen _______,
Monarchs of Atlantia, and to their successors. You will serve them and theirs
against all nations to the best of your ability.
<BR><BR>
You shall be a true Provost, teaching others to uphold our traditions, to love
truth and knowledge, and to hate falsehood and ignorance, as you and other
Provosts do. You shall teach only those who have proven themselves worthy of the
responsibility that comes with this knowledge; as such, you shall not teach any
suspect person, as a murderer, a thief, a common drunkard, or those who be
common quarrelers.
<BR><BR>
When called upon to render judgment on any prize, game, or bout, you shall
promptly speak the truth of what you have witnessed as it appears to you,
setting aside all bias.
<BR><BR>
You shall lend your strength to any Provost or Free Scholar should they be
wronged, and if you know of any Provost who has fallen victim to circumstance,
you shall put them into remembrance at all prizes and games as you would have
others do for you.
<BR><BR>
You shall not promote any Free Scholar without the accord of two Provosts
besides yourself. You shall not arrange a Free Scholar prize without first
consulting the Provosts and attaining their general good will on behalf of
the candidate, but after which you will make your plans known to all.
<BR><BR>
You shall always be merciful to any who are true subjects of Atlantia, and
should you have the upper hand over them, you shall not kill them should
you be able to preserve yourself without further bloodshed.
<BR><BR>
You shall keep this Provost's Oath in all things declared unto you in the
presence of your brethren of this Academie, on your sacred honor.

Imprimis, you shall uphold, maintain and keep to your power all such
articles as shall be declared unto you here in the presence of these
your fellow Provosts.
<BR><BR>
You shall be loyal subject to our Sovereigns, King ____ and Queen ____,
and their successors, monarchs of this Realm of Atlantia, and not to
know of any treason but that you utter it within four and twenty hours
at the farthest, and sooner if you can, and to serve them and theirs
against all nations to the uttermost of your power.
<BR><BR>
You shall be a true Provost from this day unto the last of your life,
to love and serve the truth and hate falsehood, as other Provosts have
done heretofore, according to the ancient orders of our science.  You
shall not teach any suspect person, as a murderer, a thief, a common
drunkard, or such as be common quarrelers, but to avoid your hands of
them and keep no company with them, so nigh as you can. You shall not
teach any person, whatsoever he or they be, without you do assure
yourself that they will uphold the ideals and tenets of this Academie.
<BR><BR>
That any prize or game where you shall be, either to sticle or stand by,
you shall say the truth of that which you shall see when you be asked
or called to speak.  And when you shall be so asked or demanded, you
shall give true judgement of that which you shall have seen, so nigh
as you can, setting all affections apart, and rightly to judge without
fraud or guile, even as you would be judged.
<BR><BR>
You shall aid and strengthen to your power (if you see them wronged) and
help all Provosts and Free Scholars of this science, all widows and
fatherless children, and if you know any Provost of this science that
is fallen into sickness being in poverty, you shall put the Provost in
rememberance at all prizes and games and other assemblies that they may
see him to have duty, and have him in rememberance the sooner for your
good word even as others shall do for you if the cause were a like.
<BR><BR>
You shall not allow or enable any Free Scholar license without the
consent of two Provosts at the least beside your self. And you shall not
compact with any person under coullier or deceit to keep school for you
or in your name so that he or they shall have their profit thereof and
you bear the name by which means other Provosts which stood in place for
it have their livings taken from them but you shall farther, do your
dilligence and good will to the apprehending and putting down of all such
as do take upon them to teach without sufficient licences or law full
authority to the great scandle and hinderance of our science.   
<BR><BR>
You shall at no time set forward any manner of Provost or Free Scholar
prize but that you first call the Provosts together requiring their
goodwills in that behalf and with the consents of them having their
goodwills to give lawfull warning as you shall be instructed by the
assents, where it shall be played, and what day is appointed.
<BR><BR>
You shall always be merciful, and whereas it may happen that you have the
upper hand of your enemy, that is to say, under your feet, or without
weapon, or some other advantage, you shall not kill him, if he be a true
subject of Atlantia, saving yourself without danger of death or bodily
hurt according to your first oath which you received entering to learn
this science.
<BR><BR>
You shall keep or cause to be kept, our orders, rules, and conventions in
all prizes, as we have declared unto you.

You shall keep this Provost's oath in all points now given and declared
unto you in the presence of these, your brethren of this Academie, on
your sacred honor.
