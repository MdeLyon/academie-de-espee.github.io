Let's play a game with pointy sword,<BR>
But not against a sword and board.<BR>
<BR>
Cuts and thrusts are blows you call,<BR>
If one hits then you must fall.<BR>
<BR>
You must not whip,<BR>
You must not flail,<BR>
The blades must all be safe and hale.<BR>
<BR>
Don't punch your friends with fist or mace,<BR>
Don't punch your friends in gut or face.<BR>
<BR>
Don't punch them here,<BR>
Don't punch them there,<BR>
Don't kick or punch them anywhere.<BR>
<BR>
You must be covered head to toe,<BR>
No bare body part may show<BR>
<BR>
On your noggin wear mask and hood<BR>
to keep your thinker thinkin' good.<BR>
<BR>
We'll test your hood,<BR>
We'll test your mask,<BR>
With an automatic test-o-flask.<BR>
<BR>
Dagger, cloak and shield are cool,<BR>
And a left-hand-whopper-bopper-tool.<BR>
<BR>
Your weapons must be inspected well,<BR>
By a weapon-inspector-detector-snell.<BR>
<BR>
We'll check them high,<BR>
We'll check them low,<BR>
If we don't like them, Out they go!<BR>
<BR>
You should be polite to those you meet,<BR>
Do not foul and do not cheat.<BR>
<BR>
Playing this game is lots of fun,<BR>
But don't stay too long in the sun.<BR>
<BR>
So whether you lose,<BR>
Or whether you win,<BR>
Be nice and you can play again!<BR>
